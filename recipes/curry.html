       <h1>Ingredients</h1>
       <ul>
        <li> 2 pounds chicken breast    </li>
        <li>1/2 cup cooking oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 Â½ teaspoons minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>


        <ol>
            <h2>Step 1</h2>
            <li>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt.</li>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken in the hot oil in batches until 
                completely browned on all sides. Transfer browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.</li>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil remaining in the skillet. Cook and stir until onion 
                turns soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir curry powder, cumin, turmeric, coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water
                 into the onion mixture; allow to heat together for about 1 minute while stirring.</li>
            <h5>Step 4</h5>
            <li>Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes.
                 An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drizzle with lemon juice to serve.</li>     
        </ol>
    
    
    
    
    </ul>
