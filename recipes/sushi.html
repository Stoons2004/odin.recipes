            <li>6 sheets nori (dry seaweed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons wasabi paste</li>
            <li>8 ounces smoked salmon</li>

            <h3>Directions</h3>

        <ol>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <li>Soak rice for 4 hours. Drain rice and cook in a rice cooker with 2 cups of water. Rice must be slightly dry as vinegar will be added later.</li>
            <h5>Step 2</h5>
            <li>Immediately after rice is cooked, mix in rice wine vinegar; spread rice on a plate until completely cool.</li>
            <h6>Step 3</h6>
            <li>Place 1 sheet of seaweed on a bamboo mat; press a thin layer of cool rice on seaweed, leaving at least a 1/2 inch top and bottom edge 
                of the seaweed uncovered. This is for easier sealing later. Dot some wasabi on rice; arrange smoked salmon, cucumber, and avocado on 
                rice about 1 inch away from the bottom edge of seaweed.</li>
                <h7>Step 4</h7>
            <li>Slightly wet the top edge of seaweed; roll up tightly from the bottom to the top edge with the 
                help of the bamboo mat. Cut salmon roll into 8 equal pieces and serve. Repeat for other rolls.</li>
        
        
        </ol>
